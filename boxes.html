<p>Expanding Divs</p>

<p>This is the first content box
<!-- This is extra content to test your expanding boxes. A fluid layout is a type of webpage design in which layout of the page resizes as the window size is changed. This is accomplished by defining areas of the page using percentages instead of fixed pixel widths. -->
</p>


<p>This is the second content box
<!-- A div tag defines a division (or section) of a HTML document. DIV elements can be used to structure HTML documents as a hierarchy of divisions. So it would be fair to say that 'div' is short for 'division'. -->

</p>



<p>This is the third content box
<!-- The Document Object Model (DOM) is an application programming interface (API) for valid HTML and well-formed XML documents. It defines the logical structure of documents and the way a document is accessed and manipulated. -->
</p>



<p>This is the fourth content box
<!-- Social media is the collective of online communications channels dedicated to community-based input, interaction, content-sharing and collaboration.  -->
